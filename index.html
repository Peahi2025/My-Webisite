                              <p> We came up with a <strong> co-operative game </strong>
                                        players work togther to defeat bosses.
                                        they have to fill in blanks to attack enemies </p>

                              <p> we came up with multiple ideas of teamwork

                                        we did alot of drawings about enemies and characters

                                        we tried to make a fun game thinking about the world and the characters

                                        we each shared ideas on the looks of the enemies

                              <p> i learned from finishing this project that there is alot to consider about when making a video game for players to enjoy

                                        like to balance both the different elements for the players to have fun

                              <p> The <strong>GOAL</strong> is to get 25,000 points to start a tour you will need to buy new instruments with each instruments you get double the music amount of music notes

                                        <strong>Rules</strong> there are really none

                                        <strong> The Process</strong>
                                        Once i started i was going with another game called Ninja Dogers a ninja doging projectiles but i scraped it and started <strong> Band Clicker</strong> its a clicker game envolving clicking instruments
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>What i have learned</strong> so i learned that i should start small and take it slow before i try tackling a big game project.Something i would have done differently is changing the background and add more unique things to my game.
                              </p>
                              <h2>Entry 3#</h2>
                              <strong> Arduino Project </strong>
                              <strong> Tools used </strong> i used 2 Buzzers, 1 resistor, 2 long jumper wires, and 4 short jumper wire's. when starting i was confuzed a on what to do i went with a traffic light but a quick change i went with the buzzer.
                              <img id="Top.view jpg" src="Top.view jpg" alt="Top.view jpg">

                              <img id="side.view jpg" src="side.view jpg" alt="side.view jpg">
                             
                              <p> when making my Arduino project i used the same concept for the tutorial and combined it with the buzzer but unfortunately, i didn't add any code so it wasn't a 100% done project.But it was supose to make 2 different melodys from the 2 buzzers to make a good or cool sound. </p>

                              <p> <strong> Lastly</strong> something i learned was to use my time a little more wisly. I should have did research at home on how to put code in my Arduino project and i probably should have also considered coming in for help </p>
